## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a simple Minecraft clone written in Python that can run on Windows 11 and macOS.

## Installation

Requirements:
- üêç Python 3.13+ installed (As of May 2025)
- ‚öôÔ∏è GPU capable of OpenGL 3.3+

Next, clone the repository to your local machine:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Xata/ubiquitous-cube-game.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:
```zsh
cd ubiquitous-cube-game
```

Create a virtual environment with venv:
```zsh
python -m venv .venv
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Be sure to activate the virtual environment before the next step!

‚ö†Ô∏è On Windows 10/11 you may need to change the execution policy of scripts by running:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
```

Install the dependencies:
```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the game
Once installed run the game:
```zsh
python main.py
```
